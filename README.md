<h1>TOH</h1>

This project implements the classic Tower of Hanoi game using C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows players to interactively solve the puzzle by dragging and dropping disks between pegs. Key features include:</p>

Interactive disk movement via mouse input<br>
Graphical representation of pegs and disks using the graphics.h library<br>
Dynamic difficulty setting (adjust the number of disks)<br>
Double buffering to avoid screen flickering<br>
Feel free to explore the code and try solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle!<br>
