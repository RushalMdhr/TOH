# TOH
This project implements the classic Tower of Hanoi game using C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows players to interactively solve the puzzle by dragging and dropping disks between pegs. Key features include:

Interactive disk movement via mouse input
Graphical representation of pegs and disks using the graphics.h library
Dynamic difficulty setting (adjust the number of disks)
Double buffering to avoid screen flickering
Feel free to explore the code and try solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle!
